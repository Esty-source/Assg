## HTML File Explanation

### Overview
The HTML file defines the structure and layout of the authentication page, including both the sign-up and sign-in forms, tab navigation, password requirements, and a confirmation modal. It uses semantic HTML, accessibility best practices, and data attributes for JavaScript interaction.
